These images are created through the use of text based commands that are formatted to comply with XML specifications. SVG images are scalable to the size of the window in which a web page is viewed and will adjust in size and resolution based on the window in which they are displayed, unlike JPEG and GIF images which always remain a specific size. Other benefits of SVG include being a smaller file size than JPEG and GIF image files, being resolution independent - so an SVG image can scale up or down on any type of web device, accordingly, being able to link to parts of an image, and containing complex animation.</p>
