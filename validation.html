    <div class="reflection-text">
        <p>Before coming to this university, I knew nothing about HTML and CSS. And know I was even capable of building an entire website by myself! Of course, I had do search a lot in the website and my teacher gave us a lot of material to be based on.</p>
        <p>Every class, we would be introduced to important topics about the web. Each topic is a key to success. From the basic syntax to compress pictures and embed videos. With this, we were able to build our first website.</p>
        <p>I think it’s great that everyone like me that chose different specializations, have web development in the first year because this module is so important nowadays. Websites are everything today. Websites are branding. Every company has a website, so everyone can understand what is that about and stuff like this. A lot of websites also offer the opportunity of purchasing online.</p>
        <p>If I create my own company or even work at one eventually, I can build a website and increase our view, so we can get a lot of clients faster. A good-looking web page gives confidence to the users and shows reliability. </p>
        <p>Every known company has a website. Good examples are Samsung, which was an inspiration for me, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, eBay, and a lot more.</p>
        <p>At the phase we are now, it is nonsense not to keep on track and follow the good practices. Good practice leads to success, and success… leads to money! Which in the end, is an important objective, because with no money, no fun!</p>
        <p>It was difficult to start my website, since I didn’t have any experience. I was always thinking of amazing designs in my head but couldn’t code my thoughts at all. So I decided to start simple and ended up drawing what I wanted and what I would be capable of coding.</p>
        <p>There are some sketches below of some pages, so you will see how I based myself to come up with this design. And in MGP in UI Design page, there are some as well. </p>
